# Dataminer

The MySQL8.0 database was selected for the project.
MySQL is the most trusted and widely used open source database platform in use today. 10 out of the top 10 most popular and highly-trafficked websites in the world rely on MySQL.  MySQL 8.0 builds on this momentum by delivering across the board improvements designed to enable innovative DBAs and developers to create and deploy the next generation of web, embedded, mobile and Cloud/SaaS/PaaS/DBaaS applications on the latest generation of development frameworks and hardware platforms.  MySQL 8.0 highlights include:

  * MySQL Document Store
  * Transactional Data Dictionary
  * SQL Roles
  * Default to utf8mb4
  * Common Table Expressions
  * Window Functions
And much more...

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
